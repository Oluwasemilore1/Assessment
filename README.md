# Assessment

the twoSumNubers function accepts two arguments(nums and target)
the iteration variable i and j loops through the nums array and returns two numbers from the nums array
the numbers are matched with an if conditional statement checking if their sum returns the desired value for the target
and then returns a new array of length = 2 containing just the two numbers.
